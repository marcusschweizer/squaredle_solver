## squaredle_solver

This is a script to autmatically, and recursively, solve Squardles!

https://Squaredle.app

You must manually enter the board as a 2d array

The script will recursively run through all combinations to find all the possible words

# issues
- It does not use the same dictionary as Squardle
- it does not divide core words from "bonus" words
- doesn't automatically integrate with the app


# prerequisits
- you may have to download nltk wordnet dictionary: nltk.download('wordnet')
