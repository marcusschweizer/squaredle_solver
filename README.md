## squaredle_solver

This is a script to autmatically, and recursively, solve Squardles!

[Squaredle.app](https://squaredle.app)

You must manually enter the board as a 2d array and select that board at the top of __main__

The script will recursively run through all word combinations to find all the possible words on the board

# issues
- It does not use the same dictionary as Squardle, i understand Squaredle uses scrabble dictionary or mariam webster?

# todo
- use same dictionary as squaredle
- divide core words from "bonus" words
- download latest board from squaredle.app automatically
- output solutions onto squaredle.app automatically


# prerequisits
- you may have to download nltk wordnet dictionary to your python environment: nltk.download('wordnet')
